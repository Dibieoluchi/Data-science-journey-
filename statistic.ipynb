    "1. Data Collection:Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest in a systematic and organized manner. It involves the collection of data points or observations to support research, analysis, or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves the use of numerical and graphical methods to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. This includes measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics help in simplifying large amounts of data and making it more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. The primary goal is to gain insights, identify patterns, and generate hypotheses that can inform further analysis or research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimation: Estimation in statistics refers to the process of using sample data to make inferences about the characteristics of a population. It involves estimating population parameters, such as means or proportions, based on sample statistics. Common methods of estimation include point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It involves formulating a hypothesis about a population parameter, collecting and analyzing data, and then using statistical tests to assess the evidence against or in favor of the hypothesis. The goal is to make decisions about whether to accept or reject a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis."
